Go through each  vocabulary entry from the following list:
$ARGUMENTS

Fill them according to the template found in "German/Templates/Vocab Word Template.md"
You should strictly follow the template and fill in accordingly
If the entry contains sections or properties that are not found
in the template, you should ignore them.
For example some words may have audio section, but the template
doesn't have it, then just skip and do not try to fill there anything.
Notes should be clear, realistic, practical, extensively explaining
usages, patterns, and related grammar.
