description: Create a vocabulary entry for the specified word(s)
agent: lingua
---

Go through each  vocabulary entry from the following list:
$ARGUMENTS

Fill them according to the template found in either "German/Templates/Vocab Word Template.md" or "English/Templates/Vocab Word Template.md"
You should strictly follow the template and fill in accordingly
If the entry contains sections or properties that are not found
in the template, you should ignore them.
For example some words may have audio section, but the template
doesn't have it, then just skip and do not try to fill there anything.
Notes should be clear, realistic, practical, extensively explaining
usages, patterns, and related grammar.
NOTE:

- article is not required for English, so do not try to fill it.
- for words that have multiple meaning (which is actually the case quite often), especially
the ones that can be in multiple parts of speech, the meaning field should include all of them separated by a semicolon
but be as concise as possible.
- the same goes for translations - use one for each meaning/part of speech separated by a semicolon.
- pronunciation should follow official IPA (american standard for English)
